# Frontend Mentor - GitHub user search app

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a solution for a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge that consists on building a landing page that looks as close to the given design as possible. The goal is to improve my web layout skills by building a realistic project.

## The challenge

My challenge was to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I could use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge so I used React.js


User should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Able to scroll to view from navbar
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See if Email is valid


Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.


### Expected behaviour

- On first load, show the profile information for Octocat.
- Display an error message (as shown in the design) if no user is found when a new search is made.
- If a GitHub user hasn't added their name, show their username where the name would be without the `@` symbol and again below with the `@` symbol.
- If a GitHub user's bio is empty, show the text "This profile has no bio" with transparency added (as shown in the design). The lorem ipsum text in the designs shows how the bio should look when it is present.
- If any of the location, website, twitter, or company properties are empty, show the text "Not Available" with transparency added (as shown in the design).
- Website, twitter, and company information should all be links to those resaources. For the company link, it should remove the `@` symbol and link to the company page on GitHub. For Octocat, with `@github` being returned for the company, this would lead to a URL of `https://github.com/github`.
